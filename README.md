# DA-medical-data
This is a repo for AI Launch Lab's project, including a report and my draft Jupyter notebook codes.

### About this project
This project is one of the tasks I did in AI Lauch Lab during my internship and the target is do data analysis for the raw medical data set.

You can find my final report in this repo named **Report_MD_data_analysis**, which is the final version and I won't make big change for the file. However, for all of the ```ipynb``` file inside the ```codes``` file are my draft codes and I haven't clean them up as a neat version, so to be continued... :raised_eyebrow:
